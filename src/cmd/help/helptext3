-command

TERM		command format

EXPLANATION	Once you receive a command prompt from your login shell, you
		can execute any ULTRIX-11 command.  The ULTRIX-11 commands
		have one of the following formats:

		     command [ -option... ] [ argument... ]

		     command [ key... ] [ argument... ]

		     command [ keyword... ] 
	  
		Options are always preceded by a minus (-).  Keys are not 
		preceded by a minus.  Keywords are followed by an equals sign 
		(=) and the appropriate argument.  Square brackets indicate 
		optional information.  Where used, ellipsis (...) indicates 
		that more than one can be specified.
-directory

TERMS		directory and file

EXPLANATION	Your directories contain an entry for each subdirectory
		or data file that you assign to them.  Each directory 
		entry lists the name and file system inumber of an
		assigned directory or file.  

		Your files contain the data that you store within the 
		ULTRIX-11 file system.  Each file can have one or more 
		names, that is, one or more directory entries that point 
		to the file system information for that file.

		To access a subdirectory or file, you simply specify the 
		correct name.  The system first searches for the directory 
		entry that contains that name.  On finding the correct entry,
		the system then translates the name to the listed inumber
		and uses this number to access the appropriate file system 
		information.

RELATED		link 
-groupID

TERM		group ID

EXPLANATION	When you log in, the system establishes your group ID number.
		The system uses your group ID number to determine group access 
		permissions to all directories and files in the file system. 
		Your system administrator (superuser) normally assigns your 
		group ID number.

RELATED		userID and home (terms) 

DOCUMENTATION	chgrp(1) and chog(1) in the ULTRIX-11 Programmer's Manual 
-home

TERM		home directory

EXPLANATION	When you log in, the system automatically places you in your
		home or login directory.  Your home directory generally is 
		identified by your user login name.  Your system administrator 
		(superuser) normally creates your home directory in the 
		appropriate file system.
		
RELATED		groupID and shell
-inode

TERM		inode

EXPLANATION	An inode is a data structure that defines a directory, data 
		file, or special file in an ULTRIX-11 file system.  Each inode
		lists the file type (directory, data, or special); mode (access
		permissions); userID of owner; groupID of owner; size (bytes); 
		either block addresses (directory or file), or major/minor
		numbers (special); last time accessed; and last time modified.

RELATED		inumber and mode
-inumber

TERM		inumber
 
EXPLANATION	An inumber is the inode index number that is listed in a
		directory entry.  The system uses this inumber in accessing
		the appropriate file system information (inode) for the 
		directory, data file, or special file.

RELATED		link and inode
-kernel

TERM		ULTRIX-11 kernel

EXPLANATION	The kernel is the memory-resident portion of the ULTRIX-11
		system that schedules processes, services system calls,
		maintains the file systems, and interacts directly with
		your system hardware.
-link

TERM		link

EXPLANATION	When you specify a file name as a command argument, the 
		system searches for a directory entry with that assigned
		name.  This directory entry essentially is a link to the
		appropriate file system information for that file.

		Within the ULTRIX-11 file system, a file can have more than
		one directory entry, that is, more than one link to the 
		appropriate file system information.

RELATED		directory and inumber

DOCUMENTATION	ln(1) and ls(1) in the ULTRIX-11 Programmer's Manual
-mode

TERM		mode settings

EXPLANATION	Access to every file in the ULTRIX-11 file system is 
		determined by the file's mode settings.  Each file
		has three mode settings.  The first applies to the 
		file's owner, the second to members of the owner's 
		group, and the third to all others.  Each mode setting 
		consists of three permission bits: read, write, and
		execute.

		For data files, the read bit determines read permission: 
		allows you to open the file and read data.  The write bit 
		determines write permission: allows you to open the file
		and write data.  The execute bit determines execute 
		permission: allows you to execute the program or shell
		script. 

		For directories, the read bit determines list permission:
		allows you to list the contents of the directory.  The write 
		bit determines create permission: allows you to create an 
		entry in that directory.  The execute bit determines search 
		permission: allows you to access an inumber from an entry in
		the directory.

RELATED		userID, groupID, and inode

DOCUMENTATION	ls(1) in the ULTRIX-11 Programmer's Manual
-multiuser

TERM		multiuser mode

EXPLANATION	Multiuser mode, as the terms imply, is when the system
		allows more than one user to be active at any given time
		(time sharing).  

		During multiuser startup, the system automatically 
		prepares for time sharing by executing the commands from
		the /etc/rc file.

RELATED		rc
-password

TERM		login password

EXPLANATION	If your login name is password protected, you type your login
		password in response to the password prompt.  If your login
		name is not password protected, the system does not prompt
		for password verification.  To change your login password, 
		use the passwd command.

RELATED		user and userID
-pid

TERM		pid

EXPLANATION	When you execute a command, the system assigns your request 
		a process identification number (pid).  Most of the time, 
		you do not need to know the pids of your command requests.  
		But, to send a process (command) a signal, you need to 
		specify its correct pid.  You can determine the pids of your 
		command request by executing the ps command.
-shell

TERM		login shell

EXPLANATION	Your login shell normally is the command (process) that the
		system automatically executes when you successfully log in.
		Once executed, your login shell serves as your command 
		language interpreter.  

		As a command interpreter, your shell parses the command 
		sequences that you enter from your terminal for:
 
		   Command name
		   Command arguments
		   Shell special characters

		Before it passes your command request to the ULTRIX-11 kernel,
		the shell processes all special characters in the entered
		sequence.  Your shell has a full set of special characters
		that you can use to:

		   Substitute values for shell variables
		   Generate full names from partial strings

		To generate full argument names from partially specified
		strings, you can use these shell special characters:

		   Match single character	?	 sh and csh shell
		   Match character sequence	*	 sh and csh shell
		   Match character from set	[set]    sh and csh shell
		   Match from ordered set	{set}	 csh shell
		   Match your home directory   	~	 csh shell
		   Match user home directory	~user	 csh shell

		In addition, if the csh is your login shell, you can use these
		shell commands to control your job (command) requests:

		   Display list of active jobs		jobs
		   Put job in background		bg
		   Put job in foreground		fg
		   Restart stopped job			%job
		   Suspend current job			<CTRL/Z>
		    
		Your login shell continues to serve as your command interpreter
		until you type: 
      
		   <CTRL/D>				sh and csh shell 
		   exit					csh shell only
		   logout				csh shell only
		
		Your system administrator (superuser) normally assigns you a 
		login shell (/bin/sh or /bin/csh).  To change your login shell 
		for subsequent logins, use the chsh command.  
		
		For further information about your login shell, read either 
		the sh or csh manual page.

-singleuser

TERM		single-user mode

EXPLANATION	Single-user mode, as the terms imply, is when the system
		allows only one user (superuser) to be active, running
		/bin/sh at the console.  Also, during single-user mode,
		only the root file system (/) is mounted.

		Most often, single-user mode is used during system 
		maintenance and administration.

RELATED		multiuser
-special

TERM		special file

EXPLANATION	A special file is an entry in the /dev directory that the 
		system uses in accessing a configured I/O device.

		When you access a special file, the system activates its
		associated I/O device.

RELATED		directory 
-stdin

TERMS		stdin, stdout, and stderr

EXPLANATION	Upon initial execution, your login shell establishes three 
		files for primary (default) I/O processing: 
		
	 	   Default input file				stdin  
		   Default output file				stdout 
		   Default error message file			stderr 

		Each is set to your terminal.  Unless these are redirected, 
		your shell reads input from and writes output and error 
		messages to your terminal.
 
		The basic shell redirection characters are:

		   Redirect stdin from file	<file		sh and csh 
		   Redirect stdout to file	>file		sh and csh 
		   Append stdout to file	>>file		sh and csh 
		   Redirect stdout and stderr	>file 2>&1	sh
						>&file		csh 
		   Pipe stdout to command	| cmd		sh and csh 
		   Pipe stdout and stderr	2>&1 | cmd	sh 
						|& cmd		csh
		  
 
		For further information about shell redirection, read the
		sh or csh manual page.

-ulimit

TERM		ulimit

EXPLANATION	The ulimit command is built in to each shell interpreter
		and imposes a maximum limit (in Kbytes) on the size that
	 	a newly created file may become.  The ulimit command is
		recognized by the csh, sh, and sh5 shell interpreters.

		The default ulimit size is 1024 Kbytes.  By using the 
		ulimit command, an ordinary system user may decrease 
		this size, but only the superuser may increase it.

TERM		user login name

EXPLANATION	To log in to your system, you type your login name
		in response to the login prompt.  Your user login
		name can be your first name, last name, initials,
		or nickname.  Your system administrator (superuser)
		creates your system account which includes your user
		login name.

-userID

TERM		user ID 

EXPLANATION	When you type your user name to log in, the system 
		automatically translates your name to your system-unique
		user ID number.  The system uses your user ID number to
