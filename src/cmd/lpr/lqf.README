lqf.README:

The lqf print filter was modified to include support for
the LA210 printer being able to print greater than 132
columns of output.  The LA210 can actually print up to
219 columns, so the filter now allows up to 256 columns.

The original ULTRIX-11 V3.0 source for lqf is in the file
named lqf.c.V3.0, while the improved version is in lqf.c.
