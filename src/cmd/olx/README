Many changes to the USEP package.

The sysx program has been split into 3 parts:

	sysx_m.c generates sysx 
		Which does all old sysx functions with the exception of
		creating and running scripts.

	sysx_c.c generates sysx_c
		Which is called on by sysx to create a script.
		Scripts are still executabe by the shell, even though
		the shell is not used to run them under sysx control.

	sysx_r.c generates sysx_r
		Which is called on by sysx to run a script.
		Scripts entries are now run by using fork/exec to
		allow for restart capability. Eventflag information
		is now generated dynamically when script execution
		starts (the z flag is not in the script file).
		Sysx_r also handles a number of commands 
		(Stop, Help, List, Print running script, Restart 
		and shell command execution(!)).
		The prompt from this portion of sysx is "run>".
		
overall changes:
	Handling of shell command execution is improved.
	Log file monitoring is turned back on after a stop
		command as long as there are still exercisers 
		running that are using logfiles.
	Process group 31111 is used by all exercisers to allow
		for reliable termination of exercisers run under
		sysx, shell or csh control.
	The "sysxstop" command has been added to send the quit signal
		to all processes which are in the sysx process group
		(31111). The "s" command in sysx has the same effect.
	All exercisers, when not run from sysx, print a message on
		the standard error output indicating that they are
		detaching from the terminal and to use the "sysxstop"
		command to stop them.
