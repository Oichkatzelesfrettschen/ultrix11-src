This directory contains various support routines used by other parts of
the pascal system.  Fpnofetchi contains the floating point interpreter
for nonseparate I/D (11/34, 11/40, 11/23) machines without hardware floating
point.  The fpterp directory contains an old interpreter for a separate I/D
non-floating point machine; see the comments there if you need it.
