The malloc in this directroy is the SYSTEM V "Fast Malloc",
as documented in section 3x of the ULTRIX-11 Programer's Manual.
The SYSTEM V specification lists this malloc as the default,
however, the source code for SYSTEM V Rel. 2 for the PDP-11
actually references the standard (smaller) malloc, while the
larger version is found here, in libmalloc.a.
