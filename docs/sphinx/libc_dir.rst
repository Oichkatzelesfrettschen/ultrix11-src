Directory Handling Functions
===========================

The Ultrix libc provides a traditional directory interface
compatible with early BSD systems. Key routines include:

- ``opendir()`` — open a directory stream.
- ``closedir()`` — close a directory stream.
- ``readdir()`` — read the next directory entry.
- ``telldir()`` — obtain the current directory offset.
- ``seekdir()`` — reposition a directory stream.

These functions now include Doxygen markup within the source tree.
